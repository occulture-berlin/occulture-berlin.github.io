    As occultists we are inclined to see ourselves as heretics: dissidents from the mainstream. And yet it seems that most occult, pagan or gnostic movements follow the same route as the modern mind in general: (unconsciously) losing access to the magical reality by favoring abstract mental constructions, power-fantasies & feel-good-spirituality.

    There is no quick fix & certainly no one-fits-all solution. However, in this talk we will explore the alternative heresy of the Kosmic Gnosis, embodied in initiatic paths of Gnostic Sacramentalism & Voudon. Their adepts exalt soul-body & seek ecstatic becoming in an erotic exchange with the maternal kosmos. Instead of replacing the One with a Goddess or an over-inflated Ego, they celebrate Life in all its daemonic expressions!

    Sharing from an inside perspective, I will highlight how the initiates of this current erect strongholds of their Gnosis & provide practical suggestions for the independent practitioner to magically re-enchant their world.

    David Bramwell takes audiences on a dreamy candle-lit journey, in search of the
    occult secrets of rivers – back into a pre-Christian era when rivers and springs
    were worshipped as living deities – and a drowned village which has long haunted
    his memories.\n\nAlong the journey Bramwell battles with his own thalassophobia
    (the fear of ‘what lurks beneath’); learns about hydromancy from magician Alan
    Moore, discovers a unique forest of figs growing on the banks of the Don and encounters
    Jarvis Cocker on his own adventures, sailing down the Don on an inflatable inner
    tube.\n\nHis journey finally brings him face to face with the goddess of primordial
    waters, Danu, who gave her name to the Don.\n\nWhile using the river Don as the
    focal point for a psycho-geographical journey, at heart this is a meditation on
    the symbolic and ritual power of water and its association with feminine power.

    Did “positive thinking” and “mental science” help put Donald Trump in the White House? And are there other kinds of “occult politics” at work in the world today?

    In my book Dark Star Rising: Magick and Power in the Age of Trump, I look at the strange magical and esoteric ideas that are informing postmodern politics in the United States and Russia in the twenty-first century.

    From New Thought to Chaos Magick to the far-right esotericism of Julius Evola and the Traditionalists, a web of connections stretches out across the globe bringing together such disparate characters and phenomena as Norman Vincent Peale, Pepe the Frog, the Alt-Right, Vladimir Putin, President Trump, Reality TV, “meme magick” and much else in a weird tangle of postmodern occultism in which reality is up for grabs, facts give way to internet fictions, and truth is a negotiable commodity.

    My talk will look at this post-truth alternative fact landscape in which reality is defined as what you can get away with.

  description: What is light and what is sight? How do the artificial light producing
    inventions of the last few hundred years influence our consciousness, our dreams
    and our imaginations? How do we see within our dreams? What are the mechanisms
    - biological and spiritual of ‘vision’. How are outer light projections diminishing,
    altering or potentially enhancing the dark radiance of the light within our souls?
    We used to worship the sun, now we appear to be worshipping light-emitting technology.
    Light from the world produces a negative impression when we close our eyes. Our
    powers of imagination and memory fill in the blanks and our dream visions are
    coloured light impressions that mimic the world we see outside, as they interpret
    the signals we receive from within. The elements within us - when we zoom into
    the most ancient and invisible level of our form - are entangled with everything
    else in the universe. We are the beads of dew on a spider’s web, we tremble, we
    reflect. The dream realm is a place to tap into universal memory, a place where
    no time exists, where seeing is woven into the fabric of the dream world, we see
    with every atom of its creation, we visit the realm we emerged from and the realm
    we shall enter upon death. Dreaming is training for the otherside. When technology
    produces a dream making machine that generates visuals from within the human,
    rather than projecting onto the human - we'll be going somewhere very different.

    integrate all the different aspects of their being - their angelic and animal
    nature, as well as their masculine and feminine in an alchemical, tantric embrace.
    This required huge courage and vulnerability from the initiate to face and integrate
    the extreme ends of what it means to be human. In this experiential workshop,
    Jon Darrall-Rew will guide us through a modern version of this process, bringing

  description: Satan was born about 3000 years ago in the desert of the Near East.
    His faces and reputation have changed over the centuries, but his name has remained
    the same. It represents knowledge, opposition, personal development… the force
    that takes us out of our comfort zone, our paradise, and that pushes us to create
    worlds in the image of our desires. Satan exists, but as to His true nature, it
    is not such that the crowd believes it to be. To talk about Satanism, as with
    any other philosophy or religion, it is important to be based on history and solid
    facts, not on fuzzy notions that often turn out to be false presumptions. From
    the old Hebrew manuscripts to The Satanic Temple, that name which still rhymes
    with fear for many, continues to inspire the rebel, the artists, the non-conformists,
    those who provoke the establishment. “Spiritual atheists", embracing the Hebrew
    root of the word "Satan" as "adversary", they consider Satan as a positive archetype
    that represents pride and liberty.

    Pattern Manipulator - Palace Map - Probability Matrix. Per Manus Post Meridiem Plus Minus Private Messages. Public models, personal moments.
    22 black and white prints of the Major Arcana from The PM Tarot, designed by Peter Horneland. Produced through digital collage, with source material gathered through combining divinatory principles and information technology, creating unexpected (even to the artist) juxtapositions that then has to be composed so as to represent and reinforce the traditional symbolism of each card. The overloaded nature of the cards’ aesthetic lends itself well to both symbolic saturation and systemic analysis, leaning into the Tarot’s syncretic nature in modern times, as well as intuitive contemplation and free association through the almost Rorschach-like patterns. From pop culture references to petroglyphs, from the mundane to the mystical.

    the 1960s and 1990s, discussing the impact that publication has made on the establishment
    and legitimization of Thelema, forwarded by Aleister Crowley in 1904 as a new
    religious movement in contemporary Western culture. The resurrection of Thelema
    in the middle of the 20th-century is a complex story. It involves contentious
    claims to heirship in a complex structure of hierarchy as well as copyright discrepancies
    to written material. \n\nWhile this presentation exclusively focuses on a historical
    account of the Thelemic movements known as the Ordo Templi Orientis and A∴A∴ in
    their crucial periods of abeyance and revival, the overarching question centers
    around the importance of a movement’s literature and who owns its copyright. It
    will be seen that an epic battle for legitimization and authority ensued within
    the Thelemic occulture, culminating in legal battles for the acquisition of copyright
    and incorporation."

  description: |-
    It is not true that in order to read Tarot you have to study card by card or read many books. It is much easier than it is considered to be! Tarot reading is unique for every person who approach cards because there are no rigid rules. You create your rules! To read Tarot is to describe what you see.
    But how to start? How not to be overloaded with the pictures and symbols?
    We will use Poker cards, containing 56 cards to learn about substance and transitions of energy between cards.
    So everyone would learn how to intuitively do a fortune-telling. Then we will switch into Tarot.
    Our intuition knows the answer, cards can be used as a permission slip to manifest the material from intuition into words.
    This will be very practical workshop, hopefully with fun. Showing that we are masters of cards, however long is our adventure with them. It is us who decide if they are occult, joyful or whatever we would consider them to be.

    \"spirits of place.\" Taking Berlin as a subject we will take a closer look at
    some of its psychogeography, and mythology, moody river gods and places of power.
    \n\nOne goal is to examine together how to interface with \"placeness\" as an
    art and magical practice. An easy and exciting method of doing so is \"Randonauting\",
    the exploration of places determined by a set of geographic coordinates calculated
    by a quantum random number generator. The initial goal of this technique developed
    by the \"Fatum Project\" was to see what happens when people visit arbitrary locations.
    It unexpectedly led the randonauts to discoveries of strange places, weird artifacts
    and even mystical journeys. \n\nIn the workshop an introduction to the method
    will be given and how it can be applied to set off synchronicities, how to use
    it for divination or other magical applications, or simply for exploring familiar
    as well as foreign places for fun."

    and visionary. His art has been categorized as Surrealism or Fantastic Realism,
    he termed his art as”Esoteric Realism”, in which creativity is used as a tool
    for Consciousness exploration. In the early 90’s, Tchaicovsky began expanding
    his two-dimensional paintings into 3D animation and in the process became one
    of the pioneering artists who contributed to the history of 3D animation as an
    art form. His work has appeared worldwide since it was featured in the “Gate to
    the Mind’s Eye” and “Odyssey into the Mind’s Eye”. It stood out because it was
    one of the few 3D works that deserved to be called truly creative, meaningful

    drawing, experimental audio-visual, and installation. She finds inspiration in
    DIY culture, arts from the ancient times, art brut, aspect of occultism and feminism
    in the world. \nExpressing a contemporary hell of anxiety, trauma, dark thoughts,
    and humanity’s madness, drawing is a form of ritual therapy for her, reflecting
    current societal taboos as well as her own fear and obsessions, with drama and
    humor.  She presents an alternate reality––hallucinatory, phantasmagorical, bleeding.
    \n\nHer latest project is a series of drawings, created with her own blood, questioning
    the simulacrum of violence and resistance, and drawing parallels between mutilation,
    destruction, and creation. « Secret Society » series, is the meeting between the
    visible and the invisible."

    at Otherworld Retreats. She is originally from the traditional, ancestral, and
    unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples, also known as Vancouver, Canada.
    Her spiritual journey truly began in 2013 when she began seeing an energy healer.
    After feeling called to heal others for a long time, Kyra received her first tarot
    deck in 2015 and has been reading the cards for others ever since. In March 2019,
    she began her training in Celtic shamanism under John Matthews and experienced
    a spiritual awakening. \n"

    Shamanism is a worldwide, ancient practice that has increasingly been experiencing a resurgence in the Western World. At the same time, there has also been a rise in people searching to learn more about their ancestry, in particular amongst the children of European immigrants in North America. For many, the shamanism of Indigenous cultures doesn’t satisfy what they are searching for as it is not tied to their ancestral heritage. With approximately 80 million people from all over the world having Celtic heritage, Celtic shamanism has gradually grown alongside the New Age movement and into present day.

    Celtic shamanism opens up the door for many people to reconnect to their lineage and by doing so, rediscover themselves. When we work with our ancestors, we reconnect to the rhythms of the Earth and what it truly means to belong. In this lecture, Kyra will be sharing her personal experience with Celtic shamanism, awakening, and the importance of seeking out our own ancestry.

    Africa, the root bark of the shrub Tabernanthe Iboga has been considered a sacred
    tool for centuries. It serves as medicine as well as a catalyst for spiritual
    initiation. Massive doses of Iboga induce several day long near-death-experiences
    that cause the astral body to detach from the physical body. The Initiate wanders
    the ancestral realms and astral planes, gains information about karmic entanglements
    and learns about the hidden forces of the cosmos.

    In the early 1970s, Timothy Leary began to receive cosmic transmissions in what has become known as the “Starseed” transmissions. At the same time, Robert Anton Wilson found himself in his “Chapel Perilous,” receiving transmissions from somewhere around Sirius. This marked a turn in the thinking of both Leary and Wilson towards cosmic futurism as well as the beginning of their collaboration.

    This talk wants to explore the implications of the transmissions for their collaboration which they called SMI2LE (Space Migration, Increased Intelligence, Life Extension). This was on one hand a magical project that wanted to use collective will and language to actualise a desired future while it, on the other, can be seen as a forerunner to transhumanism, embracing technology and libertarianism, aiming to create a new type of human through the reception of channelled texts.

  bio: "www.schahmani.com\nInsta schahmani \n\nThe Schahmani Story \nAll the staves
    are inspired by real old Icelandic magic spells.\nwe both share a belief in the
    endless universe.\nNature is our nature.\nLove is the key to the light.\nWe produce
    the staves with love and take care of the stones.\nWe clean them and give them
    energy and charge them with a special code for spirituality happiness and protection.\nThe
    Talismans are never 100% identical.\nIt's absolutely handmade, the staves are
    925 silver.\nIf your heart tells you what your dreams are about, you don't dream
    anymore."
