They cover from ancient Shamanism, through to the Sybils of Ancient Greece, the Vala of the Northern Europeans and of course through to the modern practise of Drawing Down the Moon.

    "description": "<p>Aleister Crowley wrote The Gnostic Mass in 1913 while travelling in Moscow, Russia. The structure is similar to the Mass of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, communicating the principles of Crowley's Thelema. It is the central rite of Ordo Templi Orientis</p><p>Crowley explains why he wrote the Gnostic Mass in his Confessions:</p><em><p> While dealing with this subject I may as well outline its scope completely. Human nature demands (in the case of most people) the satisfaction of the religious instinct, and, to very many, this may best be done by ceremonial means. I wished therefore to construct a ritual through which people might enter into ecstasy as they have always done under the influence of appropriate ritual. In recent years, there has been an increasing failure to attain this object, because the established cults shock their intellectual convictions and outrage their common sense. Thus their minds criticize their enthusiasm; they are unable to consummate the union of their individual souls with the universal soul as a bridegroom would be to consummate his marriage if his love were constantly reminded that its assumptions were intellectually absurd.</p><p>I resolved that my Ritual should celebrate the sublimity of the operation of universal forces without introducing disputable metaphysical theories. I would neither make nor imply any statement about nature which would not be endorsed by the most materialistic man of science. On the surface this may sound difficult; but in practice I found it perfectly simple to combine the most rigidly rational conceptions of phenomena with the most exalted and enthusiastic celebration of their sublimity.</p></em></p><p>The Gnostic Mass was privately performed while Crowley was at the Abbey of Thelema, and it's first public performance was March 19, 1933 by Wilfred T. Smith and Regina Kahl (pictured) in Hollywood, California at the first Agape Lodge.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The signal event of the Haitian Revolution was a Vodou ceremony that took place in Bwa Kayiman (Alligator Woods) in August 1791. According to popular legend the Houngan Dutty Boukman and Mambo Cecile Fatiman oversaw a rite in which a Kreyol pig was sacrificed to the Black God of the African slaves and to the Spirit of Liberty. Scholarly speculation about the specific nature of the rite is divided between those who believe it to have been a Dahomian blood-oath, binding the cult to its emancipatory mission, and those who see it as a Petro rite summoning the fierce and violent loa (Vodou spirits) of insurrection.<p></p>A more esoteric theory proposes that, through a special Petro-Zandor rite, an egregor of malevolent loa was created and that a character called Jean-Babtiste Vixamar Legrand offered himself up for sacrifice during the ceremony. Haiti’s historic misfortunes since the revolution, advocates of this theory claim, are a consequence of the egregor’s continued existence. Only after an unbinding rite will this conglomeration of dark-matter entities cease wreaking havoc in the country. For this presentation I will discuss the Simbi-Makaya thesis and the occult notion of the egregor, relating them to traditional accounts of the Bwa Kayiman ceremony and to the traditions of the Bizango secret societies of Haiti.</p>"

The practitioners of Shamanism of South America use the songs called 'Icaros' to call the spirits of the jungle and thus receive their healing. Both types of songs share in essence the same principle, the power of the trance as a bridge or portal for the summoning of higher powers.</p><p>Ljóssál Lóðursson, a devotee to the Þursian Path, presents a lecture and descriptions of practice, that will illustrate to the audience how to develop both processes as an effective method of 'Transvocation', the liminal point between invocation and evocation related to powers of nature.</p>"

    "description": "<p>From the source documents of hermeticism through the popular movement from Aleister Crowley to Jimmy Page and celebrity occultists: Adepthood in popular occult aesthetics can perhaps be the most useful way to understand how the hermetic path of transforming the initiate into an adept through practice and study of the principles drawn from the Emerald Tablet and the western esoteric tradition. Hermetic spiritualities have drawn from mysticisms of pagan and Judeo-Christian beliefs developed by the end of the 20th century along similar lines as many New Age self-help programmes; merging conceptions of the Victorian “Knowledge and conversation with your Holy Guardian Angel” from Abramelin and the idea of Self-Mastery. Or along more Christian lines the transformation from the False Self to the True Self. Thomas Merton and his friendship with the Dalai Lama represent the non-sectarian impetus with hermetic christian or pagan thought to transgress the boundaries of religious paradigms in the pursuit of what some call Enlightenment but what initiates of the west to this day call the Philosopher’s Stone.</p><p>Through the model of the four principles, the pop culture of celebrity initiates and the various hermeneutic clashes a demonstrative model can be drawn that assists our understanding of what the four principles are and are not any useful sense. Their definition through the Hebraic model of exegesis on which the Hebrew Kabbalah and hermetic Tree of Life were developed through the Seferim Yetzirah, Bahir and Zohar I will outline is the most useful to gaining a full and practical working knowledge of the applications of hermetic philosophy and spirituality for esoteric practitioners of any tradition.</p>"

Emphases will be placed on the fact that the occult and arcana have been literally present everywhere in pre-modern Islamic civilization, from texts to architecture to daily practice itself.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Over half a century ago Robert Anton Wilson and Kerry Thornley launched a prank called Operation Mindfuck. What they did started a cultural process that has turned reality into silly putty. Wilson and his co-author Bob Shea were editors at Playboy’s letters column at the time, and they would encourage the daftest conspiracy theories, even supplying wacky letters for their own column and then commenting on them. The idea of OM was to spoof conspiracy theory and expose its absurdity, but also to destabilize people’s automatic acceptance of the authority of news.</p><p>Operation Mindfuck took aim at the idea that there is a shared, central reality which the news media accurately report upon, with occasional lapses or biases.

Discordianism brought a disrespectful scepticism to matters of religion and philosophy, and a playful approach to belief.</p><p>This ‘reality hacking’ opened up the possibility that we can ‘believe in’ magic again, that magical action can be mixed into politics. We can believe whatever we like, even to the extent of doing magic to change the world.</p><p>But of course it’s not only magicians who benefit from this attitude to belief. In today’s ‘post-truth’ society, where facts occupy a much lower level of importance than the way they make us feel, even political hustlers have caught on to magical thinking.

    "description": "<p>The Moon rules our emotions, our inner life, our subconscious and unconscious self. Being very close to earth, her vibrations influence humans, nature and animals greatly. Therefore our bodies and emotions are naturally yet strongly influenced by her cycles.  Studying the moon’s transit in the sky is an accessible doorway to guide ourselves back into aligning our lives with the natural rhythms and cosmic cycles.</p><p> Astrology is the study of the meaning behind the physical observation of the celestial bodies in the sky and their influence on us at the moment of our birth and throughout our entire life journey. It is a mapping and practical understanding of consciousness. Through the main zodiac signs, we divide consciousness in 12 main archetypal signatures which together explore the history, evolution and psychology of humanity as a collective.</p><p> Each month, the moon travels through the 12 zodiac signs, each time highlighting and revisiting different aspects of our psyche. On the new moon, the conscious awareness of the sun is seeding a new understanding in our unconscious realm represented by the moon. From there we enter a 2 weeks cycle of growing the understanding of this new evolutionary step. On each full moon, the sun opposing the moon, sheds a light on our unconscious and allows us a greater understanding of what we are ready to release and where we are going.</p><p> During this presentation we will deepen our understanding of the moon cycles and how to use the specific energies of the New Moon & the Full Moon to accompany us on our self development.  We will learn and explore how to use the transit of the moon through the 12 zodiac signs to strengthen and refine our moon ritual practice. The 4 elements of nature will help us feel into the essence of each archetype.</p><p> We will learn how to create our own personalized Moon ritual and how to channel the appropriate element to support our work, as well as the purpose and importance of making a ritual and creating a sacred space using a symbolic signature to engage our subconscious mind fully in the work.</p>"

    "description": "<p>In recent years many social and cultural anthropologists have started to re-engage with questions of ontology (i.e., questions of what actually exists). The standard approach in the humanities and social sciences has been to ‘bracket’ out such issues, essentially ignoring the problem to get on with the task of studying systems of ‘culture’ and ‘belief’ (social facts). Another tendency has been to entirely dismiss other ontologies (models of what exists) as irrational and misguided, superseded by Western scientific rationalism's dominant materialist ontology. Anthropologists have, however recently started to engage directly with the ontological implications of their fieldwork experiences (concerns that often arise through fieldwork encounters with magic and the paranormal), and to question the dominance of materialist scientific rationalism as a mode of understanding and interacting with the world. This shift in perspective has been labelled the 'Ontological Turn' (Holbraad & Pedersen, 2017).</p><p>This talk will explore the ontological turn and its implications for our understanding of the paranormal, supernatural and occult. I will survey a variety of methodological frameworks for breaking down what I have called 'ontological flood barriers' in order to open up new avenues for engaging multiple ontologies in fieldwork and scholarship. The paper will examine the influence of Edith Turner's experiential and participatory approach (Turner, 1998), Fiona Bowie's notion of 'cognitive empathetic engagement' (Bowie, 2013), Merz and Merz's notion of the 'ontological penumbra' (Merz & Merz, 2017), and Zayin Cabot's 'ecologies of participation' (Cabot, 2018), amongst others. I will also explore my own concept of 'Ontological Flooding' (which takes inspiration from the work of Charles Fort, Robert Anton Wilson and others), and how I have used it in my research and writing to make sense of my own fieldwork experiences with contemporary trance and physical mediumship practitioners in Bristol (Hunter, 2015; 2017).</p>"

    "description": "<p>This lecture traces the double Damballa serpent of virtual reality’s twin ancestry in Paganism and Vodun, through its coding and its rituals. This doubling is inherent to cyberspace’s binary DNA. Virtual reality was mystically conceived in mathematician Vernor Vinge’s sci-fi writings, and, not coincidentally, inhabited by the ‘voodoo’ loa in William Gibson’s Count Zero.  The genealogy of cyberspace can be traced back to origins in West African Vodun that precede Western computation, Leibnitz’s binary code and geomancy by many centuries.</p><p>The term Technopagan, as coined by Erik Davis (1995), designates a range of practices: “goddess-worshippers, ceremonial magicians, witches, Radical Fairies” that were floating around the internet back then, and which have been resurfacing of late in new forms, in pockets of subcultural online communities. If Davis’ 90s technopaganism was largely US-based and made up of “almost exclusively white folks drawn from bohemian and middle-class enclaves”, its current, much more culturally diverse iteration, expresses a heritage that can be traced back to pre-colonial West African Vodun coding practices.</p><p>This lecture will take a binary approach, first looking at Mark Pesce’s ‘technopaganism’ and his development of virtual reality coding (VRML). It will investigate the technopagan concept of cyberspace, particularly the way this is structured through its VRML code. It will consider virtual reality’s psychic architectures, hermetic glyphs, idea spaces, sigils, and rituals performed on the virtual astral plane, beginning with its inauguration at Pesce’s Cybersamhain ritual.</p><p>It will then examine the origins of cyberspace’s coded ontologies, in both its digital and its analogue structures, from VRML to neural net computation and nonlinear phase-space, through African Vodun’s divination practices, doubling, geometric algorithms, and ritual drum pattern as communication systems with the dead.</p>"

As we age, we accumulate experiences, lessons, a range of circumstances from which we have perceived the worlds around and within ourselves.

    "description": "<p>Astrology is one of the fields of study that is often misunderstood or relegated to the back pages of magazines and pop astrology. It is rarely seen as a tool by which to expand your self awareness and view the world around you, much like psychology. Initially stigmatisation of astrology started by the church and was perpetuated by capitalism and other dominant forms of power. This is due to the fact that astrology advocates for cyclical forms of thinking rather than linear. This isn’t to say normative perspectives haven’t affected astrology, they definitely have. What we currently see however is a shift of many astrologers incorporating intersectional feminism into their work. This in turn re-emphasizes the original purpose of astrology, which is the ability to view occurrences as part of a totality rather than as fragments.</p><p>While some remain skeptical to the benefits astrology has to offer, others have found it a means to empower themselves and their communities. So how is it that astrology can help one gain a better understanding of themselves and the world around them, especially in these times of social and political unpredictability? I aim to provide a frame of understanding via a conducted self-analysis of individual birth charts, the significations of the planets as corresponding rulers to certain signs and houses. I will look at the importance of sun, moon and rising signs as well as the meaning of the planetary cycles in the chart and the facets of life they cover. This analysis will of course be approached through an intersectional feminist lens and through this analysis I seek to shed light on the totality that is us, individually and socially speaking. Through this recognition of strengths and weaknesses I find that self-empowerment can be attained and amplified.</p>"

Partridge repurposed the term, which he initially came across in George McKay's Senseless Acts of Beauty, but subsequently traced back to artist, “esoterrorist” and self-styled “cultural engineer”, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge.</p><p>Occulture, as Christopher Partridge asserts, is ‘ordinary’; it is concurrent with all culture, the two are interrelated and analogous, indeed, occulture is an inseparable part of culture. Nevertheless, occulture is extraordinary, and it is revealed precisely by its deviance from normative culture—in its transgression of orthodox cultural meaning, dominant cultural narratives, and, even, so-called “normal waking consciousness”.</p><p>Most of the time, we are unaware that we are ‘reading’ our cultural environment, the narratives around which our lives are informed and organised have been so normalised that they usually run unawares, in the background. Occulture, however, is conspicuous. When we encounter a rupture in some aspect of normal or orthodox cultural meaning, we are forced to notice it and try and make sense of it: to interpret it. Although it is found everywhere within culture­, its very distinctive and differential presence invariably draws attention to, and is the expression of, something beyond culture.

We know that this part of the world located in North America, -yes, please check again the map- and on the border to the United States has been terribly affected by the War on Drugs, Cartels, US-Imperialism, internal corruption, and a very dark wave of dead. Thousands of human beings are found decapitated, chopped up, tortured and killed on a daily basis. The most affected are young women and girls. The brutality behind many of this killings makes us think of a very dark cult spreading around the country in addition to military and police brutality. This is a battle of forces and we need to be aware who is in charge of the most violent crimes. This year the so called left won elections in Mexico which opens new posibilities for social action.</p><p>This presentation gives an overview of drugs, violence, political power and the occult behind the scenes. Our goal is to bring awareness and connect with other people how understand the power of rituals and ancestral knowledge. We need to fight back!</p>"

    "description": "<p>On July 25th, 2014 the strange life of esoteric researcher Vincent Bridges ended just hours before the premiere of the play he had written about the life of Renaissance alchemist Edward Kelley in what he claimed was Edward Kelley’s house in Prague.  Bridges, who referred to himself as Dr. Strange because of all of the weird things that had happened in his life, supposedly died from a heart attack. Yet according to friends, shortly before his death he had recently been thanking everyone close to him, something that was totally out of character for him.  </p> <p> Most well known for his narration of several History Channel shows about Nostradamus and two books about Fucanelli, Vincent Bridges was researching the lost years of Shakespeare when he realized that no one had written a proper biography of the mysterious life of Edward Kelley.  From 2010 on, Bridges spent most of his time in Prague and greater Bohemia researching and writing about the legendary life of Edward Kelley, the secrets of the Enochian language, and the Ophanic Angelic Language transmitted to Dee and Kelley. Bridges conducted many talks and seminars that examined his theories about the Enochian language and the esoteric positioning of Prague.  </p> <p> Four years after his death, after editing by his former colleague Dr. Teresa Burns and his fiance Eliska Bridges, Bridges’ biography of Edward Kelley was finally published and released in May 2018 at a memorial held for Vincent Bridges in the same house where his play was to be performed, The Donkey and the Cradle. In his biography of Edward Kelley, Bridges made many wild and unsubstantiated original claims about Edward Kelley, John Dee, and Shakespeare.  This talk will examine the period of time Bridges spent in Prague and will highlight the original theories that he concocted and promoted.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The Indus valley culture is well known for the sophistication of a people who had architectural and cultural prowess, which flourished for over 700 years before inexplicably abandoning their cities to return to a more pastoral lifestyle, even in the face of great regional climatic changes.  Many scholars have made attempts to account for this abandonment, citing overpopulation, shortage of food due to climate change among other factors, yet these people were some of the most adaptable farming communities of their time and the city sites show no signs of mass losses due to starvation. An alternate proposal here is that consideration given to the effects that the transposition of earlier shamanistic beliefs and practices had on the latter cultural cosmography could go some way to explaining this reversion back to the pastoral lifestyle. In this talk a framework will be outlined for the presence of shamanism and the use of folk magic within the culture of the earliest known people in the region, those of Mehrgarh, Balochistan. Connections will be proposed between their shamanistic relationship with nature, the spirits that occupied the higher realms in these regions and perception of time and space.  Giving an overview of some uses of folk magic and divinatory practices within this context allows for the elucidation of advantages these practices would have afforded them, hence diminished, during their oppidan existence.</p><p>The continuum this talk promotes is one that begins with exploration of folk magic and the presence of shamanistic practices with the attainment of alternate states of consciousness through entheogens as another method of engagement with these alternate realms. The decline of culture through global meteorological and botanical changes and how a newly developed methodology to access higher plains of consciousness became a catalyst for the reversion, from their more materialistically-complex societies in favour of reconnecting with folk magic, shamanism and Nature herself.</p>"

    "description": "<p>This talk will initially trace the pre-history of ‘automatic writing,’ arguing that it originated in the work of visionaries such as the theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, the prophet Joanna Southcott, and the poet William Blake, and contextualise its function in various domestic writing practices associated with family worship. It will explain how these elements had a direct influence on the popularisation of automatic writing in the 1850s, a development that coincided with the advent of Modern Spiritualism.  It will then trace the various conceptualizations of the writing technique by spiritualists and its critics over the latter half of the nineteenth century. This will provide a visceral snapshot into not only the tensions that arose between secular and spiritual discourse during the period, but also shows how these jarring modes of meaning-making merged to become the complex set of beliefs now understood as automatic writing.</p><p> At the core of this talk is an argument centred on spirit communication as a method for disrupting existing models of authority. This includes the way in which it redefines our relationship with the sacred, particularly away from religious models centred on church-going and into understanding the home and nature landscapes as spheres of spiritual authority. Furthermore, it disrupts notions of personal identity, and gives rise to changing social perceptions of gender roles and the limits of self- understanding. In doing so, it illuminates an important contradiction that permeates occulture generally; by disavowing authorship and authority in undertaking magical practice, the practitioner is simultaneously taking charge of reconfiguring the world, and subverting their place within it.</p>"

Years of international travel influenced my tattoo work, which aims to enhance individual body contours with timeless and graphically description creations. I choose to concentrate on a universal approach to tattooing through the usage of mathematical and geometrical designs. The application of these patterns and formations are derived from natural phenomena, such as the reaction-diffusion mechanism. Principles of proportional harmony, seen in numbers and shapes, are the very definition of beauty and can be seen as the quintessence of aesthetics. Exploration and utilization of this infinite source of inspiration is significant to my artwork and personal interests.</p><p> A symbol, which I call sakrosankt, which first appeared to me as a carved bone pendant, has appeared twice in my life. It has evoked an unusual sense of attraction and familiarity, yet its cultural and religious origin remains unknown. Deeper investigations have lead me to the discoveries of seven fundamental geometrical proportion systems. Sacred Geometry, speaking to us on a transpersonal level, is the tool in my attempt to unveil the mysterious conundrum surrounding the sakrosankt symbol. My aim as its mediator, is to include it with my artwork, to create awareness and ultimately to bring it into being via conscious art projects which support environmental work.</p><p> These projects intend to provide a collective possibility to dissolve our karmic guilt towards our unique and nurturing entity, mother earth, whilst, at the same time, induce the individual with a liberating feeling of being part of something bigger than itself.</p>"

Shaltmira’s creative field in wide and she is using different medias wisely to prove her point, which is inner monarchy. Recently Shaltmira expanded her creative field and started making sonic sigils with Michael Cashmore, culminating in TRANSFORMATION RITUAL, during the Psychic TV concert in Berlin. From murals to post-documentaries, from canvases to public speaking - everything she does has deep philosophical undertones. There is method to the chaos, and she knows it. Shaltmira is functioning as urban shaman, shaking up the rational mind in order to create the space for the miracle. She utilizes absurdity, mess and complexity,  randomness, high brow & low brow, and discordian humor and lives her life as if it would be the the piece of art itself. Angel to some, demons to others, she will open your heart chakra if you let her and reprogram your mind in a blink of the eye. Embrace her art as you embrace the Void. All is one and one is none!

    "description": "<p>The Golden Circle Rituals are born out of my own spiritual journey of seeking for a deeper meaning in life and like minded women. This Ritual is to empower and support women and men on their own journey to their purest self, to reconnect with mother nature, to learn, grow and flow with her.  There are many different kind of Circles, like the Back to Nature Circle to take us back to what really matters and to our true mission in life, the Empowering Self Love Circle to arise the magik of self love and inner beauty, the Sisterhood Gathering to reconnect with our sisters and femininity and the Moon Circles, as we are all affected and led by the intense power of mother moon. </p><p>I also use these magikal circles to create sacred spaces to reawaken the elemental power, the inner wise human, that already lives deep down in ourselves. As it is finally time to listen to our own intuition and to live in our true power. It is time to rise and shine, to grow and heal together, to go back to yourself, to go back to nature.</p>"

    "description": "<p>A ceremonial rite invoking ancient wisdom through the exploration of the serpentine archetype and blood sacrament, where the body is the sacred space in which we commune with mind and soul.</p><p>Performance artists Justine Peralta and Luna Duran undergo an extreme physical ordeal breaking the skin boundary in order to induce trance states. In this state they become vessels for the expression of non-verbal wisdom. Those in attendance who bear witness to this offering are invited to project any questions they may have toward the performers to then integrate their visions at a later time when they so chose, however they see fit according to their personal practice. This is a communal invocation for those who wish to participate.</p><p>Blood sacrifice has been used as a vision inducing technique by many different cultures throughout time. In modern times many of these practices have been adapted and borrowed from for similar purposes. This particular performance gains inspiration from practices originating in central and South America.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The working consists of daily observations during October, of ritual praxis, sacred sites and first hand observations of the female body, the affects psychologically and physically when in devotion, ritual and heterotopic space.</p><p> Starting with smaller basic rituals and moving on towards a working at the end of Oktober, the culmination of this research being a Samhain Ritual and fire in Stockholm ... a continued initiation, as artist and witch, the ash and dirt collected from this and sound/image recorded on site between the new moon in Oktober and the new moon in November ...these elements make up the ground material to be used during the performance.</p><p>This is not an interactive performance in the sense of a communal ritual, neither is it entertainment for an audience. Rather an effort to try and communicate the visceral experience, the sensations as feeling, the smell, sounds of the solitary ritual experience. Including sound made from the field recording and images from site, allowing the spectator to fall into their own meditative consciousness as I perform the piece. Using my body as signifier. Following the layers of consciousness as I communed with the earth, site, space around me.</p><p>Rather than an academic study – following the prescriptive aspects when relating to transgressions. I try to subvert the the often male gaze pertaining to the sacred feminine ...in analysis of the esoteric female, as goddess or witch . .. as passive vessel or medium. I choose instead to focus on the experience as an integrated whole, a phenomenology of the female body in relation to land, ownership and territory. As Above, so Below ... with a reminder that as witches the ground we walk upon is often precarious. The personal is always political.</p>"
